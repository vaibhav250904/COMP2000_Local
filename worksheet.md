# Task 0

Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  > GitHub and Bitbucket are both cloud based services offering hosting of git repositories as well as a user-friendly web front end to aid in visualising the contents of those repositories. Both sites also offer CI/CD pipeline services to automate the build and deployment of software. Neither is necessarily better than the other.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  > Matthew Roberts <matthew.roberts@mq.edu.au>
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?

  > Jon Mountjoy <jon@heroku.com>

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  > DavePearce <dave01001110@gmail.com>

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  > A: most recent commit is Thu Aug 18 04:45:08 2022 +0000
  > B: most recent commit is Thu Aug 11 10:10:28 2022 +1200
  > So in the case of both projects, no, these projects are not currently active. The people writing these project have probably moved on to do something else.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
  > Some search via your favourite search engine should get you some suggestions.
  > There are at least two ways of answering this, either by the largest number of commits:
  ```
  git config diff.renamelimit 0
  git log --name-only --pretty=format: |sort|uniq -c|sort -rg|head  
  ```
  > A: 32 app.py
  > B: 696 build.num
  > or probably a better indication is to see how many lines of text have changed:
  ```
  git diff --stat $(git log --all|grep commit|tail -n1|sed -e 's/commit //')|sort -k3rn|head -n1
  ```
  > A: static/data/forces.csv                             | 23588 +++++++++++++++++++
  > B: src/main/java/wyil/lang/WyilFile.java              | 7790 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
